Hi, I'm Ante. I work as a senior **researcher** at [Infobip](https://www.infobip.com/), focusing on how people interact with agentic AI systems and how those systems can be evaluated and improved in practice.

### Current Work

At Infobip, I develop and deploy AI-driven solutions for large-scale communication platforms. My work currently centers on:
 - **Conversational aspects of AI**
    
    Designing and studying human interaction with conversational agents built on LLMs
 - **AI Evaluation**
    
    Using LLMs as automated judges and evaluators
 - **Trustworthy AI**
 
    Reducing bias and improving reliability in conversational and evaluation systems

### Background

Before moving into this crazy world of AI, I worked as a senior **data scientist** in retail. I led an assortment-optimization team responsible for monthly performance analytics used by category managers to make decisions on assortment, pricing, promotions, shelf space, and inventory across top supermarket chains in the Balkans.

Earlier in my career, I was a junior **academic researcher** in computational electromagnetism. My research focused on modeling human exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields, alongside teaching courses in wireless systems and electromagnetic compatibility. I earned my PhD in 2023 with the thesis that introduced a novel technique for the efficient assessment of spatially averaged dosimetric quantities on complex 3D surfaces.

### Research Interests

In chronological order from the most recent:
- Bias in LLM-as-a-judge systems
- Conversational recommender systems
- Information retrieval
- Time-series modelling and forecasting
- 3D point-cloud processing
- Physics-guided machine learning in 3D
- Numerical methods for computational problems on 3D point clouds
