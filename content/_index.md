Hi, I'm Ante. I work as a researcher in AI focused on conversational experience at [Infobip](https://www.infobip.com/).

Before my current role, I worked as a data scientist in the retail industry.

A lifetime ago, I did research in computational electromagnetics studying the effects of radio waves on human skin.
